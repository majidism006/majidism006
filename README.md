- 👋 Hi, I’m @majidism006
- 💻 Developer | 🎮 Gamer | 🌟 Dreamer
Hi there! I'm Ismail, a passionate developer who loves bringing ideas to life with code. Whether it's crafting clean, user-friendly interfaces or building engaging games, I enjoy solving puzzles and creating things that make people smile.

🚀 A little about me:

🌟 I'm a Computer Science and Bioinformatics Specialist at the University of Toronto (and a proud International Scholar!).
🔧 I specialize in React, TypeScript, Python, and Java, but I'm always curious to learn new tools and frameworks.
🎨 When I'm not coding, you’ll find me doodling on Procreate, leveling up in Unity, or experimenting with Figma to design intuitive user experiences.

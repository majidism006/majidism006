- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @majidism006
- ðŸ’» Developer | ðŸŽ® Gamer | ðŸŒŸ Dreamer
- I'm Ismail, a passionate developer who loves bringing ideas to life with code. Whether it's crafting clean, user-friendly interfaces or building engaging games, I enjoy solving puzzles and creating things that make people smile.

- ðŸš€ A little about me:

- ðŸŒŸ I'm a Computer Science and Bioinformatics Specialist at the University of Toronto (and a proud International Scholar!).
- ðŸ”§ I specialize in React, TypeScript, Python, and Java, but I'm always curious to learn new tools and frameworks.
- ðŸŽ¨ When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me doodling on Procreate, leveling up in Unity, or experimenting with Figma to design intuitive user experiences.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @majidism006
- ðŸ’» Developer
- I'm Ismail Majid, a passionate developer who loves bringing ideas to life with code. Whether it's crafting clean, user-friendly interfaces or building engaging games, I enjoy solving puzzles and creating things that make people smile.
- ðŸŒŸ I'm a Bioinformatics Specialist and a CS & Stats minor at the University of Toronto (and a proud International Scholar!).
- ðŸ”§ I specialize in Python, and Java, but I'm always curious to learn new tools and frameworks.
- ðŸŽ¨ When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me doodling on Procreate, leveling up in Unity, or experimenting with Figma to design intuitive user experiences.
